# kotlinx-coroutines-workshop

This repository is a collection of hands-on modules and examples to explore and learn about Kotlin Coroutines in practical scenarios.

## Modules

### dashboard-coroutines

The `dashboard-coroutines` module is a Kotlin-based server-side application that demonstrates practical usage of Kotlin Coroutines. It showcases how to build responsive dashboards by leveraging asynchronous programming, structured concurrency, and integration with remote services. The module includes:

- A controller (`DashboardController.kt`) that handles HTTP requests and coordinates data fetching.
- A service layer (`RemoteService.kt`) that simulates or interacts with external systems asynchronously.
- An application entry point (`DashboardCoroutinesApplication.kt`) to bootstrap the server.

This module is designed to help developers understand coroutine patterns for non-blocking I/O, parallel data fetching, and efficient resource management in backend applications.

More modules will be added to cover additional coroutine use cases and patterns.
